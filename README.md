## Relevance
This project demonstrates how emotions can be recognized in poems. The key findings of this research includes how modern NLP techniques often fall short in recognizing emotions in poetry and creative writings. Transformer models like BERT and DistilBERT were compared to baseline models ( LR, BoW, NB ) for result analysis.
